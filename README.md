The Kattis-Problems repository contains solved Kattis problems from https://open.kattis.com/problems. I worked on Kattis problems that was assigned from my professor for MCS-394 Competitive Programming at Gustavus Adolphus College. Some of the problems was also involved for another course, MCS-375 Data Structure and Algorithms, since most Kattis problems focuses on running time and possible different cases for each problem. I used three different programming languages through out the Kattis problems such that I used Python 3, C, and C++. This was a semester long assignment that our professor grades our work was how many problems a student can solve until the end of semester.
